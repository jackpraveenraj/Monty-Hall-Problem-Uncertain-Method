# Monty-Hall-Problem-Uncertain-Method

# Project Description:
A fully functioning Python Program to implement uncertain method for solving Monty Hall problem.
# Algorithm:
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle named after the host of the TV series, ‘Let’s Make A Deal’. The game involves three doors, given that behind one of these doors is a car and the remaining two have goats behind them. So you start by picking a random door, say #2. On the other hand, the host knows where the car is hidden and he opens another door, say #1 (behind which there is a goat).  You are now given a choice, the host will ask you if you want to pick door #3 instead of your first choice i.e. #2.
The graph has three nodes, each representing the door chosen by:
1. The door selected by the Guest.
2. The door containing the prize (car)
3. The door Monty chooses to open.
